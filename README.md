Gets the price displayed on shopping sites and shows the equivalent hours of your life spent to earn that money.


## Usage
- This script asks a user for their Approximate Annual Salary/Wages/Earning.
- This value is stored in your OWN browser's local TamperMonkey DB.
- Based on this Annual Earnings and the Price of an item displayed in shopping sites, the average hours required for you to work to buy each item is displayed nearby.
- For now, this script works on Amazon.com, Amazon.in, Flipkart.com, Paytm and Google Store. 
- A small Reset button also will be added by this Userscript on the above sites. This can help you update future increase/decrease in earnings.
- If you spend a lot online and want to see this info, this script will display the hours near by the actual price of an item (hopefully to spend less).
